1. Scan the prefix expression in reverse order (right to left)
2. If the symbol is an operand, then push it onto the stack
3. If the symbol is an operator, then
       a) pop two operands from the stack in the following order
          operand1 = pop()
          operand2 = pop()
       b) create a string by concatenating the two operands and the 
          operator after them

          string = operator1 + operator 2 + operator
          
       c) push the resultant string back to stack
4. Repeat the above steps until end of prefix expression
5. pop the string representing the postfix expression on stack and return
