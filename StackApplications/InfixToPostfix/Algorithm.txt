Scan the symbols of the expression from left to right and for each symbol
do the following:

a) If the symbol is an operand
      > print that symbol onto the screen
b) If the symbol is left paranthesis
      > push it on to the stack
c) If symbol is a right paranthesis,
      > pop all the operators from the stack upto the first left paranthesis and 
        print them on the screen
      > Discard left and right paranthesis.
d) If symbol is an operator
      > If the precedence of the operators in the stack are greater than or equal
        to the current operator then, 
            -- pop the operators out of the stack and
               print them onto the screen, and 
               push the current operator onto the stack.
      > else 
           -- push the current operator onto the stack.
