1. Scan the postfix expression from left to right
2. If the symbol is an operand, then push it onto the stack
3. If the symbol is an operator, then
      a) pop two operands from the stack in the following order:
         operand2 = pop()
         operand1 = pop()
      b) Create a string by concatenating the two operands and the operator 
         before them

         string = operator + operand1 + operand 2
      c) push the resultant string back to stack
4. Repeat the above steps until end of postfix expression
5. pop the string representing the prefix expression on stack and return.
