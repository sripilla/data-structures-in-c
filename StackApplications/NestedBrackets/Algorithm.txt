ALGORITHM - balanced brackets using a stack

1. Create an empty stack
2. Scan the  expression from left to right
3. If the symbol is a left bracket, then push the symbol onto the stack
4. If the symbol is a right bracket, do the following
      a) If the stack is empty,
                print "Invalid expression: right bracket without matching left                            bracket"
      b) else, pop an element from the stack
                If the popped element does not match the current right bracket,
                print "Invalid expression: Mismatched Brackets"
5. After scanning all the symbols of the expression
      a) If stack is empty
                print "Valid expression: brackets are well balanced"
      b) else, print "Invalid expression: Left brackets are more than right                              brackets"
